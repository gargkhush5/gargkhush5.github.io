# Social Links Management Implementation

## Features Implemented
- Created a `social-links.js` script to handle social links management functionality
- Updated the `manage-social.html` page to use the new script instead of inline JavaScript
- Added proper loading and saving of social links to localStorage
- Implemented dynamic updating of social links on the social.html page
- Ensured that social links persist across sessions
- Added auth-ui.js to the manage-social.html page for consistent authentication UI
- Updated the author dashboard to clearly show which features are available vs. coming soon
- Created a test-social-links.html page to verify functionality

## How It Works
1. When a user visits the social.html page, the social-links.js script loads the stored links from localStorage (or uses defaults if none are found)
2. The script then updates all the social links in the DOM to match the stored values
3. When an authenticated user visits manage-social.html, they can edit the links
4. When they click "Save Changes", the script stores the updated links in localStorage
5. The next time social.html is loaded, it will display the updated links

## Files Modified
- social.html: Added social-links.js script
- manage-social.html: Replaced inline JavaScript with social-links.js and added auth-ui.js
- author-dashboard.html: Updated Content Management section to show feature status
- scripts/auth-ui.js: Updated to ensure sidebar authentication UI is updated on page load

## Files Created
- scripts/social-links.js: Core script for managing social links
- test-social-links.html: Test page to verify social links functionality

## Technical Details
- Social links are stored in localStorage under the key 'socialLinks'
- Default links are provided if no stored links are found
- Auth UI is updated consistently across all pages
- Each social link platform has its own input field in manage-social.html

## Future Improvements
1. Add server-side storage of social links (currently using localStorage)
2. Implement form validation for social links
3. Add favicon preview for each social platform
4. Add the ability to toggle visibility of specific social links
5. Implement the ability to add new social platforms
