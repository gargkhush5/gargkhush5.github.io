# Contact Form Setup Documentation

## Current Configuration

### Contact Form (contact.html)
- **Form Service**: Formspree
- **Form Endpoint**: `https://formspree.io/f/xldbvybe`
- **Method**: POST
- **Fields**: Name, Email, Message

### How It Works

1. **User submits form** → Submission goes to Formspree
2. **Formspree processes** → Sends email notification to your email
3. **Data stored** → In your Formspree dashboard (not locally)

### Where to View Submissions

#### Contact Form Submissions:
- **Primary**: Check your email for notifications from Formspree
- **Dashboard**: Login to [Formspree Dashboard](https://formspree.io/forms/xldbvybe)
- **Features**: Download CSV, reply directly, manage spam

#### Submission Management (contacts.html):
- Provides direct access to Formspree dashboard
- Located at `/contacts.html` (accessible when logged in)
- Redirects users to view submissions in Formspree

### Benefits of Current Setup

✅ **No server required** - Static site with form handling  
✅ **Spam protection** - Formspree includes anti-spam features  
✅ **Email notifications** - Instant alerts for new submissions  
✅ **Data backup** - Submissions stored safely in Formspree  
✅ **CSV export** - Download all submissions as spreadsheet  

### Dashboard Integration

- **Author Dashboard** provides direct link to Formspree dashboard
- **Contacts page** redirects users to Formspree for submission management
- **All submissions** accessible via Formspree dashboard link

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want submissions to appear directly in your dashboard:
1. Use Formspree API to fetch submissions
2. Set up webhooks to receive submission data
3. Store data in localStorage or a database

For now, the current setup works perfectly for a static portfolio website!
